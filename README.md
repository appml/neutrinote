# neutriNote (Community Edition)


## What is neutriNote?

Let's say plain text is the most basic unit of written information.

Then the boundaries between written thoughts in formatted / unformatted text, math (LaTeX), rich markdown, ASCII drawings, and so on, are artificially imposed.  neutriNote reclaims the paradigm by preserving all contents in a text-centric searchable repository. Unlike the emphasis on traditional text editing function found in most mainline writing apps, neutriNote focuses instead on the long-term searchability of information so that cognitive load may be reduced through note-taking, with an writing experience totally open to customization.


## Community Edition

This edition is identical to [**Play Store Edition**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appmindlab.nano) with zero Google related dependencies.  While already the case that almost every aspect of neutriNote can be [customized](https://appml.github.io/nano/), Community Edition opens up the possibility to customize and sustain at source code level.


## Design Philosophy

neutriNote is designed to be ultra compact so as to operate smoothly on as many aging hardwares as possible.  Features and dependencies are carefully vetted to minimize impacts on search performance and to provide highly performant long note editing, with enough customization [options](https://appml.github.io/nano/) for users to build their own sustainable tools within the app.  Its versatile search mechanism is based upon a simple, non-hierarchical data structure that provides near instant access O(1) to any piece of text stored by the app.  Think of these as cognitive shortcuts to recall anything from your writings anytime with minimal lags.
